# Worshiptab Bass Lines

## 🎼 Project Description

This repository serves as a centralized, maintainable collection of simple, foundational bass guitar tab lines for traditional and modern hymns and worship songs.

The primary goal is to provide clear, reliable support for church ensembles by using basic root-and-fifth movement, suitable for quick integration and consistent performance.

## 🎸 Tablature Format

All bass lines are provided in standard 4-string tabular notation.

**Key features of the notation:**
* **Simplicity:** Lines focus on the root, fifth, and octave, avoiding complex runs.
* **Maintainability:** Clear formatting allows for easy review and modification.
* **Chord Alignment:** Each measure is labeled with the corresponding chord.
